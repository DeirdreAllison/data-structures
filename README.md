Ruby Data Structures
====================

See examples of data structures in Ruby including:
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Table
  * Used Shift-Add-XOR hash
  * Each bucket uses a single linked list to manage collisions
  * Tested with dictionary of more than 235,000 words
  * With test case hash table length of 1024, each linked list is about 200 items, length could be adjusted to shorten list length
  * Value reversed as arbitrary representation of data
